# Using Random forest to design an on-line electrical motor false diagnose and predict system
# Abstract
Electric motors are the important power source for intelligent manufacturing; however, motor eccentric is a serious problem that will occurs when robots or machine have operate for a while. This fault will cause damage to power modules, but traditional solutions were mostly depends on expensive sensors and the are not able to make a precise presdiction. In this project, we will foucus on the eccentricity fault by collecting big data and do the further classification and prediction based on Random Forest.
