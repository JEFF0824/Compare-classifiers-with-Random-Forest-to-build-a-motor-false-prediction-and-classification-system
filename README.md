# Using Random forest to design an on-line electrical motor false classifying and predicting system
# Abstract
Electric motors are the important power source for intelligent manufacturing; however, motor eccentric is a serious problem that will occurs when robots or machine have operate for a while. This fault will cause damage to power modules, but traditional solutions were mostly depends on expensive sensors and the are not able to make a precise presdiction. In this project, we will foucus on the eccentricity fault by collecting big data and do the further classification and prediction based on Random Forest.

# Data introduction
A proper data of electrical motor false classification consists of the real-time operating raw data and controlling command of rolling element bearings via the acquisition station (showed in Fig.1), data processing, feature extraction from the data sets and classification into functional (State0) or defective (State1, State2, State3) status (showed in Fig.2) of rolling element bearing.
